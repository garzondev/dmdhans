I had the pleasure of being a participant of the AIDPH Federal Service Immersion (FSI) Program and Fellowship for a week in September 2024. We toured several federal buildings, such as the NIH, HRSA, and PCORI. In addition, we met with federal representatives from the House of Representatives, and Senate in order to advocate for dental health for all. </br>
