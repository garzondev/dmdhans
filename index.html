I am currently the only Clinical Preceptor at RSDM Department of Orthodontics. In this position, I perform the same duties as the Orthodontic Residents, such as attending to my own patients and their orthodontic needs, diagnosis, treatment planning, banding and bonding, archwire change, and debonding. I have utilized our department's new 3D printing lab to create Essix retainers from 3D prints, scanned using iTero scanners.
