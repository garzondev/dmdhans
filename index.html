I was one of two dental fellows to be admitted into the NJLEND (New Jersey Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities program) Fellowship Program. This program is under the umbrella of the The Boggs Center on Disability and Human Development, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. In this fellowship, we learned weekly about individuals with developmental disabilities, the challenges they face on a daily basis, and the ways in which we can advocate and help them. </br>
