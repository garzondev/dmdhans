I was one of two dental fellows to be admitted into the NJLEND (New Jersey Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities program) Fellowship Program. This program is under the umbrella of the The Boggs Center on Disability and Human Development, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. In this fellowship, we learned weekly about individuals with developmental disabilities, the challenges they face on a daily basis, and the ways in which we can advocate and help them. </br>

I had the pleasure of being a participant of the AIDPH Federal Service Immersion (FSI) Program and Fellowship for a week in September 2024. We toured several federal buildings, such as the NIH, HRSA, and PCORI. In addition, we met with federal representatives from the House of Representatives, and Senate in order to advocate for dental health for all. </br>

I had the privilege of participating in a Mission Trip along with several classmates and faculty at Rutgers School of Dental Medicine to La Romana, Dominican Republic. We spent a week performing dental procedures for students and parents at a local school, such as SDF (Silver Diamine Fluoride), composite restorations, amalgams, extractions, endodontics, and prosthodontics. This experience has been my most rewarding experience, and reminded me of why I became a health professional. </br>

Throughout my time at RSDM, I volunteered at several points throughout the year. I created a website which centralized dental education resources, and created a QR code to this website. I would go to local parks and public area throughout my time at RSDM, and would distribute this, along with toothbrushes, floss, and other dental materials.
